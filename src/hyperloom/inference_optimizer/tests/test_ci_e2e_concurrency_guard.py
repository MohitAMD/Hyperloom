"""Guard for the ``ci-e2e`` concurrency group.

The workflow answers three triggers (``pull_request`` / ``issue_comment`` /
``workflow_dispatch``) and cancels in-progress runs that share its group. GitHub
resolves ``concurrency`` when the run is *created*, before the ``resolve`` job's
``if`` can decline the work, so a group keyed on the PR number alone lets any
comment on a PR cancel that PR's in-flight multi-hour GPU run and then skip
itself.

The fix keys non-``/retest`` comments to a group of their own, which only holds
while the group expression and ``resolve.if`` agree on what a retest comment is.
These tests pin that agreement; there is no way to unit-test the cancellation
itself short of running the workflow.
