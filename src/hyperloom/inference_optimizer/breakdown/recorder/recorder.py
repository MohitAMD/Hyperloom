"""Write-side of the breakdown recorder.

A :class:`Recorder` lets the code that *produces* a fact record it at author
time, into a per-session spool directory, instead of having the exporter
re-walk heterogeneous artifacts later. Each producer owns its own files:

* :meth:`Recorder.record_singleton` — one final dict per section; the owner
  overwrites its own stable file (safe: single writer of that file).
* :meth:`Recorder.record_item` — one fragment per event; uniquely named so
  concurrent producers never collide. Pass ``key`` for an idempotent
  (overwrite-on-rewrite) item that survives resume without duplicating.
* :meth:`Recorder.record_upsert_singleton` / :meth:`Recorder.record_upsert_item`
  — the same, but merged into the prior fragment payload instead of replacing
  it, for producers that emit a fact in several partial updates.

Writes are atomic (tmp + ``os.replace``) and filenames are unique per
(section, producer), so this is safe across processes and on network
filesystems (no shared-append dependency).

Every write funnels through :meth:`Recorder._write`, which is where the write
trace is emitted; ``HYPERLOOM_BREAKDOWN_TRACE=1`` turns it on (see
:mod:`.trace`).

# Per-section wire-shape registry for the breakdown recorder.
#
# Each ``session_breakdown.json`` section has exactly one owning producer, so
# there is never cross-producer write contention. A section is one of:
#
# * ``singleton`` — one final dict; the owner rewrites its own file on update
#   (last write by ``ts`` wins at assembly time).
# * ``item`` — an event stream assembled into a list. The v4 entity streams
#   (phase_transitions, subjects, operations, measurements, adoptions,
#   artifacts, trace_events) are ordered by ``ts`` then ``seq`` and deep-merged
#   by stable entity id, so repeated partial updates for one id collapse into a
#   single record; every other item section stays append-only and is
#   concatenated in ``seq`` then ``ts`` order.
#
# Derived sections (see ``DERIVED_SECTIONS``) are NOT written by producers
# during the run; they are computed at finalize from in-memory ``SharedState``
# (the Coordinator owns every input), so they never appear as fragments.
