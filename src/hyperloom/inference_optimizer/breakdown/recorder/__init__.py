"""Breakdown recorder: author-time capture of ``session_breakdown.json`` data.

Producers record facts where they are born (see :func:`get_recorder`); the
exporter assembles them at finalize (see :func:`assemble_parts`). Each section
has a single owning producer, so there is no cross-producer write contention.

Write side::

    from hyperloom.inference_optimizer.breakdown.recorder import get_recorder

    rec = get_recorder(session_dir, producer="sweep")
    rec.record_singleton("sweep", sweep_payload)          # one final blob
    rec.record_item("phase_timeline", event, key=task_id)  # event stream

Read side::

    from hyperloom.inference_optimizer.breakdown.recorder import assemble_parts, has_parts

    sections = assemble_parts(session_dir)   # {section: list | dict}

Recording is best-effort by design, so a fact that never arrived leaves nothing
behind to explain itself. Set ``HYPERLOOM_BREAKDOWN_TRACE=1`` to log every
write, naming its call site and, when a write merges into an existing fragment,
the fields whose values it changed (see :mod:`.trace`).
