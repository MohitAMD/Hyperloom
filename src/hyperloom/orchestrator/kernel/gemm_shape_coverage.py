"""Align tuned-GEMM shapes with the M keys aiter actually looks up.

aiter resolves a tuned config by trying three lookup keys in order (see
``aiter/ops/gemm_op_a8w8.py::get_CKGEMM_config`` and
``csrc/py_itfs_cu/gemm_common.cu::getPaddedM``):

1. the raw ``M``,
2. ``gl=0`` fine-grained padding — round M up to 16 (M<=256), 32 (M<=1024),
   64 (M<=4096) or 128,
3. ``gl=1`` coarse padding — ``nextPow2(M)``, clamped to 8192 when
   ``M > 8192 and N > 4096``.

Runtime M is the number of tokens in a scheduled batch, so prefill M is
data-dependent and effectively never repeats between two runs. Handing the
tuner the raw M values sampled from one run therefore produces a CSV whose keys
no runtime lookup can reach: a later run asking for M=1082 pads to 1088 and
misses a row keyed on M=1076, so aiter falls back to its default config and the
measured micro speedup contributes nothing end to end.

Keying the CSV on the padded values instead makes each tuned row cover the whole
bucket that pads onto it, which is what turns a micro-level win into an
end-to-end one.

    Two row families are emitted per observed ``(N, K)`` projection:

    ``ladder``
        Every power-of-two M rung up to the observed maximum. Because the
        ``gl=1`` lookup key is ``nextPow2(M)`` and the ``gl=0`` key pads anything
        below 16 up to 16, a complete ladder makes *every* M resolvable — which
        matters because a profile trace only ever samples a few operating points
        and cannot see decode M at all (decode replays inside a CUDA graph and
        emits no op events).
    ``fine``
        The ``gl=0`` padded key for each observed M. These are tried before the
        ladder, so where the profile does carry evidence the tuner's answer for
        that neighbourhood wins over the coarser rung.

    Args:
        shapes: Observed ``(M, N, K)`` triples from a profile trace or server log.
        max_shapes: Upper bound on the returned shape count, bounding tuning
            time. The ladder is preserved ahead of the fine rows because it is
            what guarantees coverage; ladder rungs are then dropped smallest
            first, since small-M GEMMs contribute least to throughput.
        max_m: Optional upper bound on the M the workload can schedule (e.g.
            ``max_num_batched_tokens``). Extends the ladder past the observed
            maximum when the profile under-sampled prefill.
