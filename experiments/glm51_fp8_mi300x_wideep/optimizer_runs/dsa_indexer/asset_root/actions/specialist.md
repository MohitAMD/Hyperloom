# `specialist` action playbook

## Purpose

Dispatch an LLM specialist sub-agent on the **research_lane** to investigate
one canonical gap in depth. The specialist reads advisory RecipeKB
warm-start facts, source-backed research hints, and the framework source
roots under `INFERENCEX_PATH`, and can query the PR Monitor on demand (over
the shared `PR_QUERY_REPOS` allowlist) via `mcp__pr_monitor__*` tools.
It then emits exactly one `specialist_done` intent on exit (Inv-5.3 single
exit protocol).

The specialist is the runtime implementation of the Domain Specialists in
the Arbor paper (arXiv:2606.12563) — "Arbor" being the research name for
this orchestration, so a specialist here *is* an Arbor Domain Specialist.
Unlike the deterministic Python executors (`baseline` / `explore`
/ …) the specialist is *LLM-driven*: SpecialistRunner spawns a fresh
Claude subprocess with the per-tag prompt context, an isolated
`runs/specialist/<task_id>/worktree/` (a `git worktree` rooted at
`INFERENCEX_PATH`), and a tight tool whitelist.

## Inv-5.1 update (specialist-as-patch-author, PR-A1)

Prior to this plan specialists were "research-only" — they could emit
`proposal_set` entries that fed the next `explore` grid but could not
write source patches. The new contract is:

- Specialists MAY write source patches into their own
  `runs/specialist/<task_id>/worktree/`.
- The patch files (`*.patch` / `*.diff`) are produced via
  `git diff > patches/NNN_<slug>.patch` inside the worktree.
- The physical `git apply` against `INFERENCEX_PATH` is the job of the
  `integrate_patch` action — never the specialist itself. Inv-3 (single
  tenant GPU) and Inv-1 (Coordinator-only fact-layer writer) are
  preserved by routing every source-tree mutation through that single
  orchestrator-side step.

## Who delegates this action

* **Orchestration** only. PolicyGate's `specialist_dispatch_source` rule
  rejects `delegate{action_name='specialist'}` from any other role.
  Robustness can recommend a specialist via
  `escalate_strategy_change{hint='need_specialist:<domain>'}`; the next
  Orchestration tick picks it up.

## When to delegate

The current phase MUST be `EXPLORE`. Inside EXPLORE the Orchestration
LLM should dispatch specialists as the **primary** entry into a round:

1. Read `SharedState.gaps[]` (or fall back to `last_action_failures` +
   `explore_search.winners_history` when gaps are empty).
2. Pick the top-K gaps (K up to `min(len(gaps), research_lane_capacity)`;
   `research_lane_capacity` is capped at `2 × visible GPU count`).
3. For each gap, emit one `delegate{action_name='specialist', params={...}}`
   intent in the **same** tick. Claude's tool API supports multiple
   `emit_intent` tool calls per turn, so a single LLM response fans
   out N specialists.

The Coordinator routes each delegate to the TaskRegistry; SpecialistRunner
pulls them off the `research_lane` and runs them in parallel up to the
lane capacity. By default specialists are CPU/research subprocesses. For
GPU experiments, autotuning, profiling, or a real serving + benchmark loop,
set `needs_gpu=true` and `gpu_count=N`; the Coordinator allocates serving-
disjoint visible devices from the separate specialist GPU pool and injects GPU
visibility env vars into the subprocess. On its own leased cards a GPU
specialist is free to write/run scripts, profile, autotune, and start/restart
its own servers (on any port that is NOT the production serving port 8888); the
only hard boundary is the production serving process / its cards / port 8888.

GPU requests are governed identically for **every** scope: a `scope=freeform`
dispatch that sets `needs_gpu` clears the same `gpu_specialist_ceiling`
checks (`specialist_gpu_pool_disabled` / `specialist_gpu_request_exceeds_capacity`)
as a domain-anchored one — freeform is not a GPU loophole. Pair
`mode=patch + bench=true + needs_gpu` to give a freeform specialist a real
measure → edit → measure loop on its own cards inside its worktree.

## Inputs (task.params)

| Key                  | Type     | Required | Description |
|----------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `tags`               | list     | yes*     | Canonical knowledge-domain tags (`framework`, `kernel`, `communication`, `compiler`, `systems`, `pr_intelligence`, `research_scout`). |
| `domain`             | string   | yes*     | Backward-compatible single-tag alias using a SpecialistDomain key. Required only when `tags` is absent. |
| `gap_canonical_id`   | string   | yes      | Stable id of the gap (e.g. `gap.framework.cuda_graph_inefficient.session-<sid>`). |
| `gap_symptom`        | string   | no       | Human summary of the symptom (e.g. `decode kernel at 30% HBM peak`). |
| `gap_layer`          | string   | no       | Layer label (`kernel` / `framework` / `communication` / …). |
| `gap_evidence`       | object   | no       | Profile path + numeric metrics forwarded into the prompt. |
| `max_turns`          | int      | no       | Optional turn cap (default 1000, hard ceiling 1000; `0` means unbounded). Depth is primarily bounded by the wall-clock budget. |
| `needs_gpu`          | bool     | no       | Request the specialist GPU pool for wall-budgeted on-GPU work (servers on a non-8888 port, profiling, autotune, benchmark loops). Default false. |
| `gpu_count`          | int      | no       | Number of GPUs to allocate when `needs_gpu=true` (default = serving TP so a TP-coupled gap is reproducible; set explicitly to override, e.g. 1 for a single-card kernel probe). |

## EMIT format

```
delegate{
  action_name = 'specialist',
  params = {
    tags              = ['framework'],
    domain            = 'serving_specialist',  # optional legacy alias
    gap_canonical_id  = 'gap.framework.cuda_graph_inefficient.session-<sid>',
    gap_symptom       = 'cuda graphs disabled at TP=8 on FP8',
    gap_layer         = 'framework',
    gap_evidence      = { profile_trace = '<from SharedState.last_profile_trace>' },
    needs_gpu         = false,
    # Omit max_turns for the default wall-budgeted run; set it only to cap a probe early.
  },
  idempotency_key = 'specialist-framework-<gap_id>-<round_idx>',
}
```

## Specialist contract (subprocess side)

Each specialist subprocess sees:

* A per-domain system prompt with:
  - identity + autonomy scope
  - hardware context
  - the gap statement + evidence
  - optional advisory KB context, warm-start lessons / pitfalls, and
    source-backed research hints
  - a PR-query capability block: the `mcp__pr_monitor__*` tools plus the
    shared `PR_QUERY_REPOS` repo allowlist (self-serve, no pre-warmed feed)
  - framework source root hints
  - the worktree path
  - allocated GPU ids when `needs_gpu=true`
* A tool whitelist including `Read / Grep / Glob / Bash / Edit / Write
  / MultiEdit / TodoWrite / WebSearch / WebFetch / Task` and the relevant
  MCP servers, scoped to the worktree directory (`--add-dir <worktree>`).
  GPU specialists run their measure → edit → measure / autotune loops via the
  broad `Bash`/`Write`/`Edit` grant on their leased cards (the legacy capped
  `run_bench` micro-bench tool has been retired).
  `Task` is limited to `subagent_type="hyperloom-leaf"`: leaves inherit the
  parent specialist's visible devices and their tool set omits `Task`, so
  fan-out is single-layer and stays within the parent's lane/GPU lease.
* A 60s heartbeat protocol — the subprocess writes
  `runs/specialist/<task_id>/heartbeat.json`; SpecialistRunner reaps
  stale agents after 5 minutes (`HEARTBEAT_STALE_THRESHOLD_S`).
* The exit contract:
  - one `specialist_done` intent (the SpecialistRunner harvests it from
    stdout's stream-json transcript) with payload schema
    `{ gap_canonical_id, domain, tags, proposal_set, empty, summary, ... }`.
  - optionally `patches_written: [<paths in worktree/patches/>]`.
  - `new_findings`, `residual_questions`, `confidence` (0..1).

## Output (specialist_done payload)

```
{
  "gap_canonical_id": "<echoed back verbatim>",
  "domain":           "<echoed back verbatim>",
  "proposal_set": [
    { "name": "...", "extra_args": "...", "extra_envs": {...}, "rationale": "...", "atomic": false },
    ...
  ],
  "patches_written": ["patches/001_cuda_graph_fix.patch"],   // PR-A2+: optional
  "empty":            false,
  "summary":          "short one-liner ≤ 480 chars",
  "confidence":       0.7,
  "new_findings":     ["..."],
  "residual_questions": ["..."]
}
```

When the specialist times out / dies / fails parse, SpecialistRunner
synthesises an empty `specialist_done` payload (`empty=true`,
`proposal_set=[]`, reason filled). The Coordinator never blocks waiting
for a missing specialist result.

## Followup action

If `specialist_done.patches_written` is non-empty, Orchestration should
propose `delegate{action_name='integrate_patch', params={specialist_task_id: <id>}}`
in a subsequent tick. The Coordinator will run apply → restart → gate
serially on the serving lane.

If `specialist_done.proposal_set` is non-empty and the specialist did
not write source patches, Orchestration uses the proposals as the grid
for the next `delegate{action_name='explore', params={grid: [...]}}`
round. Each variant inherits `provenance='specialist:<domain>'` for
audit; the canonical explore ledger dedups by content fingerprint.

**`atomic` (do-not-split) flag.** A specialist sets `"atomic": true` on a
proposal whose `extra_args` / `extra_envs` are a **coupled set that only
works together** — e.g. enabling MTP/speculative decoding REQUIRES a paired
`--gpu-memory-utilization` reduction to leave headroom for the draft model,
so the two flags must be benched as one variant. When `atomic` is true,
Orchestration MUST dispatch that proposal **verbatim as a single explore
variant** — do NOT decompose its flags into separate variants, drop any of
them, or re-derive your own version with only part of the coupling. Splitting
an atomic proposal silently defeats the specialist's fix (each half fails or
shows no gain on its own). Non-atomic proposals may still be curated, merged,
or reordered as usual.
