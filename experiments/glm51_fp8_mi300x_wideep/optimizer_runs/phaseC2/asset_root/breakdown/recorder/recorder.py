"""Write-side of the breakdown recorder.

A :class:`Recorder` lets the code that *produces* a fact record it at author
time, into a per-session spool directory, instead of having the exporter
re-walk heterogeneous artifacts later. Each producer owns its own files:

* :meth:`Recorder.record_singleton` — one final dict per section; the owner
  overwrites its own stable file (safe: single writer of that file).
* :meth:`Recorder.record_item` — one fragment per event; uniquely named so
  concurrent producers never collide. Pass ``key`` for an idempotent
  (overwrite-on-rewrite) item that survives resume without duplicating.

Writes are atomic (tmp + ``os.replace``) and filenames are unique per
(section, producer), so this is safe across processes and on network
filesystems (no shared-append dependency).

# Per-section wire-shape registry for the breakdown recorder.

# Each ``session_breakdown.json`` section has exactly one owning producer, so
# there is never cross-producer write contention. A section is one of:
#
# * ``singleton`` — one final dict; the owner rewrites its own file on update
#   (last write by ``ts`` wins at assembly time).
# * ``item`` — an append-only event stream concatenated into a list (ordered by
#   ``seq`` then ``ts``) at assembly time.
#
# Derived sections (see ``DERIVED_SECTIONS``) are NOT written by producers
# during the run; they are computed at finalize from in-memory ``SharedState``
# (the Coordinator owns every input), so they never appear as fragments.
#
# Producer-written sections and their fragment shape. Payloads match the
# corresponding ``schema.py`` TypedDict so assembly is structure-preserving.
