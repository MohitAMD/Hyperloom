# Kill the previous vllm/sglang server on the RayJob head pod.
#
# Submitted via Ray Dashboard REST by ``multi_node restart-server`` as
# the first phase of a server swap. Idempotent: missing PID file means
# "no previous server", which is fine.
#
# IR-5: NEVER use ``pkill -f sglang`` (would also kill Ray workers).
# We rely on the PID file written by ``launch_server.sh``.
#
# Usage: kill_server.sh PID_FILE [GRACE_SECONDS]
#   PID_FILE       — same path that launch_server.sh used in the prior cycle
#   GRACE_SECONDS  — wait this many seconds after SIGTERM before SIGKILL (default 5)
#
# Exits 0 even if there was nothing to kill; only fails if the PID file
# exists but is unreadable.
