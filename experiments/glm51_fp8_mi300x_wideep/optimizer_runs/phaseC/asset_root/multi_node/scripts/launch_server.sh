# Launch a fresh vllm/sglang server on the RayJob head pod under nohup.
#
# Submitted via Ray Dashboard REST by ``multi_node restart-server`` as
# the second phase of a server swap. Designed to EXIT QUICKLY (after
# the launch + optional health check) so the Ray Dashboard job's status
# becomes SUCCEEDED — the actual server keeps running because we
# nohup'd it and orphaned the parent.
#
# Usage:
#   launch_server.sh FRAMEWORK MODEL TP PID_FILE LOG_FILE [--wait-health|--no-wait-health] [-- EXTRA_ARGS...]
#     FRAMEWORK   sglang | vllm
#     MODEL       model path or HF id
#     TP          tensor-parallel size (int)
#     PID_FILE    where to write the new server pid (consumed by kill_server.sh next time)
#     LOG_FILE    where to redirect server stdout+stderr
#     --wait-health     poll http://127.0.0.1:8888/health up to 60s before returning success (default)
#     --no-wait-health  exit immediately after launching (use when you'll poll /health from outside)
#     EXTRA_ARGS  forwarded verbatim to the framework launcher
#
# IMPORTANT: the inference server port is FIXED at 8888 — this matches
# the SaFE Service's targetPort that brain wires up. Do NOT make 8888
# configurable here; both ends would need to change in lock-step.
