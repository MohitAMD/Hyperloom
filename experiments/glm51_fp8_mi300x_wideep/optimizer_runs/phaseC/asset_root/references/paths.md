# Paths & Session Layout

State lives under a **session directory** (per optimization run). The
**workspace root** is `$USER_DATA_PATH` (default `/workspace/hyperloom`) — it
holds shared `runtime/` and `logs/`.

## Layout (N17 default: `per_model_ts`)

**Claw / SaFE pods:** the launcher often sets `$USER_DATA_PATH` to a
run-scoped path *before* the optimizer starts, e.g.
`/hyperloom/users/<uid>/deepseek-ai-DeepSeek-V3-20260522_034024/`. That outer
directory is **platform isolation** (one Claw job). The optimizer then creates
`<model_basename>/<UTC_ts>/` inside it. Full session path example:

    /hyperloom/users/<uid>/deepseek-ai-DeepSeek-V3-20260522_034024/   ← USER_DATA_PATH (Claw)
        deepseek-ai-DeepSeek-V3/20260522T035359Z/                      ← session_dir (optimizer)

**Legacy flat layout:** set `INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_SESSION_LAYOUT=flat` so
`session_dir == workspace_root` (no `<model>/<ts>` subdirs).

## Path resolution (do not guess)

`session/paths.py` is the single authority for Hyperloom paths. The launching
agent does not need to recreate that logic in shell; it only needs to run
`install.sh`, source the generated `runtime/kernel-agent.env.sh`, and read the
session dir printed by the CLI.

| Concept | Env / helper | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace root | `$USER_DATA_PATH` → `session.paths.workspace_root()` | Shared `runtime/` + `logs/` and parent of all sessions |
| Session dir | `$INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_CURRENT_SESSION_DIR` → `session.paths.session_dir()` | Per-run directory containing `manifest.json` / `state.json` / `storage/coordinator.db` |

Open-source dependencies are cloned pod-local, not under `runtime/`:
`${HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR:-$REPO_ROOT/.cache}/`
contains Magpie, TraceLens, GEAK, and InferenceX.

**Launcher rule:** do not hand-build, create, delete, or repair paths under the
pod-local open-source root or under `$USER_DATA_PATH/runtime/`. Those assets are
owned by `install.sh`. Manual edits can corrupt another run's checkout. If
install state looks wrong, rerun `install.sh` or follow `troubleshooting.md`;
do not clone or clean the mirrors by hand.

**Session rule:** never treat `$USER_DATA_PATH` as the session dir when
`$INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_CURRENT_SESSION_DIR` is set. Read `manifest.json` /
`state.json` / `coordinator.db` from the **session dir**. For monitoring after
launch, learn the session dir from the **launch-info JSON** written by
`--launch-info-file` (`jq -r .session_dir <file>`) or, equivalently, from the
single `HYPERLOOM_LAUNCH key=value …` sentinel line the CLI prints to stdout
(`session_dir=…`). Those are the authoritative, machine-readable sources.
Never guess by walking `$USER_DATA_PATH/<model_basename>/` for the latest
`*T*Z/` timestamp dir — overlapping sessions on the same host make "latest"
pick the wrong run.

### Inputs that stay outside `$USER_DATA_PATH` by design

Read-only sources or warm-start caches, each overridable via its own env if you
want a fully self-contained session:

- **TraceLens** — `install.sh` clones public TraceLens into
  `${HYPERLOOM_CACHE_DIR:-$REPO_ROOT/.cache}/TraceLens`
  unless `$TRACELENS_ROOT` points at an operator-managed checkout. Optional
  internal extension at `$TRACELENS_INTERNAL_ROOT` (no default; internal users
  set it to their own checkout to opt in, otherwise open-source-only). The
  per-version
  `sglang_roofline_patches/sglang_<minor>_<patch>/` layout under TraceLens is
  required by `_server_patcher`.
- `/sgl-workspace/{aiter,sglang,vllm}/`
- `~/.cache/amd-ai-devtool/semantic-index/` (GEAK RAG embedding cache)
- `/shared/hyperloom/geak-memory/memory.db` (GEAK cross-session memory)

Paths emitted by agents must resolve under the **session dir** — PolicyGate
enforces this (with a framework-source allowlist for `source_file`:
`/sgl-workspace/{aiter,sglang,vllm}/` plus any paths in
`$INFERENCE_OPTIMIZER_FRAMEWORK_SOURCE_ROOTS` — colon-separated, unioned with
defaults; auto-probed by `src/hyperloom/inference_optimizer/assets/install.sh`).

Always prefer `manifest.json` / `state.json` / `coordinator.db` under the
**session dir** over guessing from terminal logs.
